    "In the <a href=\"../dqn/dqns_on_gcp.ipynb\">previous notebook</a>, we learned how to use hyperparameter tuning to help DQN agents balance a pole on a cart. In this notebook, we'll explore two other types of alogrithms: Policy Gradients and A2C.\n",

    "Hypertuning takes some time, and in this case, it can take anywhere between **10 - 30 minutes**. If this hasn't been done already, run the cell below to kick off the training job now. We'll step through what the code is doing while our agents learn."
