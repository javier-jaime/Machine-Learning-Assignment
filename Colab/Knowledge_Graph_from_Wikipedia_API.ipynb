              "'On 20 February 2020, stock markets across the world suddenly crashed after growing instability due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It ended on 7 April 2020.\\nBeginning on 13 May 2019, the yield curve on U.S. Treasury securities inverted, and remained so until 11 October 2019, when it reverted to normal. Through 2019, while some economists (including Campbell Harvey and former New York Federal Reserve economist Arturo Estrella) argued that a recession in the following year was likely, other economists (including the managing director of Wells Fargo Securities Michael Schumacher and San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary C. Daly) argued that inverted yield curves may no longer be a reliable recession predictor. The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries would not invert again until 30 January 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, four weeks after local health commission officials in Wuhan, China announced the first 27 COVID-19 cases as a viral pneumonia strain outbreak on 1 January.The curve did not return to normal until 3 March when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points. In noting decisions by the FOMC to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points three times between 31 July and 30 October 2019, on 25 February 2020, former U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Nathan Sheets suggested that the attention of the Federal Reserve to the inversion of the yield curve in the U.S. Treasuries market when setting monetary policy may be having the perverse effect of making inverted yield curves less predictive of recessions.During 2019, the IMF reported that the world economy was going through a \\'synchronized slowdown\\', which entered into its slowest pace since the Great Recession. Weakness was exhibited in the consumer market as global markets began to suffer through a \\'sharp deterioration\\' of manufacturing activity. Global growth was believed to have peaked in 2017, when the world\\'s total industrial sector output began to start a sustained decline in early 2018. The IMF blamed \\'heightened trade and geopolitical tensions\\' as the main reason for the slowdown, citing Brexit and the China – United States trade war as primary reasons for slowdown in 2019, while other economists blamed liquidity issues.The crash caused a short-lived bear market, and in April 2020 global stock markets re-entered a bull market, though U.S. market indices did not return to January 2020 levels until November 2020. The crash signaled the beginning of the COVID-19 recession. The 2020 stock market crash followed a decade of economic prosperity and sustained global growth after recovery from the Great Recession. Global unemployment was at its lowest in history, whilst quality of life was generally improving across the world. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, the most impactful pandemic since the Spanish flu, began decimating the economy. Global economic shutdowns occurred due to the pandemic, and panic buying and supply disruptions exacerbated the market. The International Monetary Fund had pointed to other mitigating factors seen pre-pandemic, such as a global synchronized slowdown in 2019, as exacerbants to the crash, especially given that the market was already vulnerable.\\n\\nCrash\\nThough the crash began on 20 February, selling was intensified during the first half of March to mid-March. During the crash, there were multiple severe daily drops in the global stock market, the largest drop was on 16 March, nicknamed \\'Black Monday II\\' of 12–13% in most global markets. There were two other significant dates of crashes in the stock markets, one being 9 March, nicknamed \\'Black Monday I\\', and on 12 March, nicknamed \\'Black Thursday\\'. To deal with the panic, banks and reserves across the world cut their interest rates, bank rates and cash flow rates, as well as offering unprecedented support to investors and markets.\\n\\n17–21 February\\nOn Monday, 17 February 2020, Asia-Pacific stock markets closed down but European stock markets closed up, while U.S. stock markets were closed in observance of Presidents Day.

This follows benchmark indices falling sharply in continental Europe after steep declines across Asia. The DAX, CAC 40 and IBEX 35 each fell by about 4% and the FTSE MIB fell over 5%. There was a large fall in the price of oil and a large increase in the price of gold, to a 7-year high. Yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.36% and 1.81% respectively.

Oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a year, while yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to 1.28% and 1.77% respectively.

Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney stated that the British economy (which saw stagnation and car manufacturing declines in the 4th quarter of 2019) was being impacted by the outbreak because it relies heavily on tourism revenues and international manufacturing supply lines. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the outbreak was posing \"evolving risks to economic activity\" and that the Federal Reserve would use monetary policy to \"act as appropriate to support the economy\" but that \"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\" Outgoing Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced a RM20 billion fiscal stimulus package.Ultimately, from 24 to 28 February, stock markets globally plummeted several percentage points, while on Wall Street the indices were down at least 10%. It was the fastest correction in market history from all-time high, taking merely six days to enter into correction territory. The sudden drop in late February was attributed to fears that China could produce a global economic shock, primarily due to quarantines imposed by the state to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which at the time was classified as an epidemic. Within weeks, stocks fell sufficiently enough to enter bear market territory. Concerning reports of the viruses spread in South Korea, Italy and Iran also prompted fear in investors, mounting to a mass sell-off in Asia-Pacific stock markets as well as European ones.\\n\\n2–6 March\\nOver the preceding weekend, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that the Bank of Japan would \"strive to stabilise markets and offer sufficient liquidity via market operations and asset purchases\", and the Bank of Japan subsequently announced that it would repurchase up to ¥500 billion ($4.6 billion) worth of government bonds.

South Korean Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki announced a ₩11.7 trillion ($9.8 billion) fiscal stimulus program.Also on 3 March, due to the Bank of Mexico declining to cut its overnight rate further, Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera Gutiérrez announced a fiscal stimulus program to accelerate government spending. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points with Federal Reserve Chair Powell stating that the central bank \"saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act\" and that \"the magnitude and persistence of the overall effect [of the outbreak] on the U.S. economy remain highly uncertain\". At the close of trading on 3 March, European and Asia-Pacific stock markets had mostly risen, but the S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell (with the Dow reversing more than two-thirds of the previous day\\'s gain). Oil futures rose and the yield on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell to record lows of 0.91% and 1.60% respectively (with the fall below 1% on the 10-year securities occurring for the first time in history).On 4 March, Asia-Pacific and European stock markets continued mostly rising (with the KOSPI alone rising by 2%), while the S&P 500 rose by 4.2%, the NASDAQ Composite rose by 3.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed the previous day\\'s loss by rising by 1,173 points (or 4.5%).

U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an emergency appropriations and pandemic countermeasures bill including $8.3 billion in government spending.\\n\\nRussia–Saudi Arabia oil price war\\nThe reduction in the demand for travel and the lack of factory activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand for oil, causing its price to fall. In mid-February, the International Energy Agency forecast that oil demand growth in 2020 would be the smallest since 2011. Chinese demand slump resulted in a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss a potential cut in production to balance the loss in demand. The cartel initially made a tentative agreement to cut oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day following a meeting in Vienna on 5 March 2020, which would bring production levels to the lowest since the Iraq War.After OPEC and Russia failed to agree on oil production cuts on 6 March and Saudi Arabia and Russia both announced increases in oil production on 7 March, oil prices fell by 25 percent. On 8 March, Saudi Arabia unexpectedly announced that it would increase production of crude oil and sell it at a discount (of $6–8 a barrel) to customers in Asia, the US, and Europe, following the breakdown of negotiations as Russia resisted calls to cut production. The biggest discounts targeted Russian oil customers in northwestern Europe.Prior to the announcement, the price of oil had gone down by more than 30% since the start of the year, and upon Saudi Arabia\\'s announcement it dropped a further 30 percent, though later recovered somewhat. Brent Crude, used to price two-thirds of the world\\'s crude oil supplies, experienced the largest drop since the 1991 Gulf War on the night of 8 March. Also, the price of West Texas Intermediate fell to its lowest level since February 2016. Former George W. Bush administration energy policy advisor Bob McNally noted, \"This is the first time since 1930 and \\'31 that a massive negative demand shock has coincided with a supply shock;\" in that case it was the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act precipitating a collapse in international trade during the Great Depression, coinciding with discovery of the East Texas Oil Field during the Texas oil boom. Fears of the Russian–Saudi Arabian oil price war caused a plunge in U.S. stocks, and have had a particular impact on American producers of shale oil.\\n\\n9–13 March\\nBlack Monday I (9 March)\\nCrash\\nPrior to opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures market experienced a 1,300-point drop based on the coronavirus and fall in the oil price described above, triggering a trading curb, or circuit breaker, that caused the futures market to suspend trading for 15 minutes.

While The Guardian initially referred to it as \"Crash Monday\", they also later referred to it as \"The Black Monday of 2020\" to distinguish it from the 1987 crash of the same name. The Associated Press also quoted an analyst of the Australian finance company OFX as saying, \"A blend of shocks have sent the markets into a frenzy on what may only be described as \\'Black Monday\\' ... A combination of a Russia vs. Saudi Arabia oil price war, a crash in equities, and escalations in coronavirus woes have created a killer cocktail to worsen last week’s hangover.\"\\n\\n10–11 March\\nOn the following day of trading, US stocks recouped some of the losses which happened on Monday, rising by more than 4%. This was attributed to a potential fiscal stimulus, such as a potential 0% payroll tax, being proposed by US President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, however, stocks fell once more, and resulted in the DJIA entering a bear market (i.e. 20% drop from the most recent peak) for the first time in 11 years, ending the longest bull market in American stock market history.On 10 March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite, and the S&P 500 all closed 4.9% up, while Asia-Pacific stock markets closed up and European stock markets closed down.

Trump\\'s initial statements were later corrected: the ban affected people who were not US citizens and who in the past two weeks had visited the 26-member Schengen Area, but did not include trade goods and cargo and excluded the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. These countries were added to the ban 3 days later. Trump did not consult with the European Union before imposing the travel ban.Carmen Reinicke of Business Insider wrote that Trump\\'s address to the nation \"failed to calm investors\\' concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak\". According to Ben Levisohn, writer for Barron\\'s, \"Dow futures were up around 300 points before the president’s address began. And then the president started talking—and futures started falling.\"\\n\\nBlack Thursday (12 March)\\nBlack Thursday was a global stock market crash on 12 March 2020, as part of the greater 2020 stock market crash. US stock markets suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash.

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down an additional 10%, the NASDAQ Composite closed down 9.4%, and the S&P 500 closed down 9.5%.

Oil prices dropped by 8%, while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities increased to 0.86% and 1.45% (and their yield curve finished normal).\\n\\nCrash\\nThe US\\'s Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash, as did the UK\\'s FTSE 100, which fell 10.87%.

Level-1 circuit breaker is triggered with a fall of 7% on the S&P 500. The trading halt occurred after the markets reached a drop of 7.2 percent within 15 minutes. The crash temporarily recovered after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York offered at least $1.5 trillion worth of short-term loans to banks for 12–13 March, but the market quickly resumed its decline soon after.
