At the start of each game, you’re given a choice between three initial Pokemon, known as starter Pokemon. In the Diamond and Pearl games, these are Turtwig, a grass-type turtle Pokemon; Chimchar, a fire-type chimp Pokemon; and Piplup, a water-type penguin Pokemon. They and many other Pokemon can undergo a metamorphosis called evolution up to two times, allowing them to get stronger and in some cases gain an additional typing.\n",
